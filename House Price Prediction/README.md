# House Prices Prediction

There are several factors involved with the sale price of a house. In this project I explored a multitude of variables to further understand what influences the value of a house and how we can use these variables to predict the sales price given specific characteristics. 
The goals for this project were to explore the dataset and variable influences on sales price, address and handle incorrect, missing values, correct inconsistencies in the variables, handle outliers, perform feature engineering and deploy various machine learning methods.

This project has been developed as part of the "Applied Data Science and Machine Learning" program of the EPFL Extension School.
