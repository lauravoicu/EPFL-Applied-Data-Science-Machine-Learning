# Image Classification

This project explores one of the core problems in computer vision, which is image classification. It is defined as the task of classifying an image from a fixed set of categories. Many other computer vision challenges such as object detection and segmentation can be reduced to image classification. Throughout this project, various machine learning techniques for image classification such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Trees, Random Forests and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been used.


For this project, the Swissroads data set which contains a couple of hundreds of images of vehicles found in the EPFL - Lausanne area including cars, trucks, vans, bikes, motorcycles and others - has been used.
The goal of this project is to test the different classifiers and techniques from the course using high-level features extracted with a pretrained convolutional neural network from TensorFlow Hub and compare the results with our own ConvNet implementation trained from the raw image pixels.


This project has been developed as part of the "Applied Data Science and Machine Learning" program of the EPFL Extension School.
