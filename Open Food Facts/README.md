# Open Food Facts

The Open Food Facts dataset from Kaggle is a data set of food products listing the ingredients and nutritional facts of more than 300,000 foods from over 150 countries in the world.
The data is meant to be free to the public to help users decode food labels, and make better food choices in general.

The project has the following goals:
- Data cleaning
- Data manipulation (choose 3 interesting questions to answer about the data and perform the necessary steps for the analysis.)
- Time series analysis
- Correlations between different data fields

This project has been developed as part of the "Applied Data Science and Machine Learning" program of the EPFL Extension School.
