# World Happiness Report

The dataset used comes from the 2017 World Happiness Report published by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network. This data was collected by the Gallup World Poll, using a set of surveys from more than 160 countries in over 140 languages. The surveys aim to analyze data from hundreds of thousands of individuals and investigate the ways in which elements of people’s working lives drive their wellbeing.
The main life evaluation question asked in these surveys is the following:
“Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?”
Each country is given a happiness score that is the sum of scores from the following 7 criteria:

- GDP per capita
- healthy years of life expectancy
- social support (as measured by having someone to count on in times of trouble)
- trust (as measured by a perceived absence of corruption in government and business) perceived freedom to make life decisions
- generosity (as measured by recent donations)
- dystopia (benchmark country corresponding to the lowest possible values in each of the criteria)

The countries are then ranked from most happy to least happy. Additionally, the report contains information about job satisfaction in each country.
The goal of this project is to investigate the relationships between these different criteria and create meaningful insights through efficient visualizations and numerical summaries.

This project has been developed as part of the "Applied Data Science and Machine Learning" program of the EPFL Extension School.
