Repository for projects developed in EPFL Applied Data Science: Machine Learning Program.

## Project 1: Word Happiness Report

**Short description:** Investigate relationships between the different criteria that influence happiness.

**Tools and technologies:** Data analysis, data visualization, Python.

## Project 2: Open Food Facts 

**Short description:** Data mining/data visualization to help users decode food labels, and make better food choices in general.

**Tool and technologies:** Data analysis, data visualization, Python, SQLLite.


## Project 3: House Prices Prediction

**Short description:** House prices prediction on the data set assembled and published by Dean De Cock. 

**Tools and technologies:** Feature encoding, feature engineering, regularization, grid search model tuning.

## Project 4: Image Classifier

**Short description:** Use various machine learning techniques for image classification such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Trees, Random Forests and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

**Tools and technologies:** SVM, KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forests, CNN.

## Capstone Project: Cyberbullying Prediction in Social Media

**Short description:** Explore different feature engineering/ different vectorizing models such as TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or pretrained embeddings such as GloVe and FastText. In this project I have built models on the datasets with different feature sets prepared in the earlier sections, using the following algorithms: Logistic Regression (baseline), Na√Øve Bayes, XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Furthermore the project explored different techniques to handle imbalanced data such as SMOTE.

**Tool and technologies:** NLP, SMOTE, Word Embeddings, TF-IDF, CNN.

## Contributing

I use this for my own projects, I know this might not be the perfect approach for all the projects out there. If you have any ideas, just [open an issue][issues] and tell me what you think.

If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and make changes as you'd like. Pull requests are warmly welcome.
